change all_urls to the only the URLs the extension will run.

`Chrome pages follows a chrome-extension:// protocol which is invalid for a redirect url. So chrome has provided a way to provide redirect url of an extension in the form https://<app-id>.chromiumapp.org/* + 'provider_cb' which works pretty well with chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(). You dont need a runnning server for it. More info : developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non`
`The github-auth example app url referenced above has changed since the original reply in 2015`

http-server starts a local server at 8080
