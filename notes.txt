          "<all_urls>"
        ],
change all_urls to the only the URLs the extension will run.

`Chrome pages follows a chrome-extension:// protocol which is invalid for a redirect url. So chrome has provided a way to provide redirect url of an extension in the form https://<app-id>.chromiumapp.org/* + 'provider_cb' which works pretty well with chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(). You dont need a runnning server for it. More info : developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non`
`The github-auth example app url referenced above has changed since the original reply in 2015`

http-server starts a local server at 8080

TODO: CLONE REACT STUDY AND USE IT TO FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE WITH THIS

React structure:
    popup.jsx --- App.jsx  --- Twitch UI Component --- Other Components
                          |--- Youtube UI Component
                          |--- Kick UI Component

Have to load unpacked from dist, manifest stays in public

cannot get these to work, test app works without them somehow but doesnt have a background script
    "content_scripts": [
        {
            "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
            "js": ["src/components/TwitchFollowList.jsx", "src/components/TwitchLogin.jsx"]
        }
    ],
    "background": {
        "service_worker": "src/backgroundTwitch.js",
        "type": "module"
    },

    webpack knowledge is def the problem, todo: research webpacks
