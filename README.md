## What does this project do?
This chrome extension contacts the Twitch API, authenticates a users Twitch login, and retrieves their follow list to be displayed.
This allows users to quickly check if their favorite streamers are online without having to load up the Twitch website.
I plan to add functionality for YouTube and Kick for one unified cross-platform follow list.
